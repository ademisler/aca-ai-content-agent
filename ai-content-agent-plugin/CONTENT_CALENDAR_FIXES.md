# Content Calendar Fixes - Version 1.3.3

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Draft Scheduling API Mismatch
**Problem**: Backend `schedule_draft` function expected `date` parameter but frontend sent `scheduledDate`
**Solution**: Updated backend to handle both parameter names for compatibility

### 2. WordPress Integration Missing
**Problem**: Scheduling only saved to meta field but didn't actually schedule the post in WordPress
**Solution**: Added proper WordPress post scheduling with `wp_update_post()` and `post_status: 'future'`

### 3. Draft Disappearing After Scheduling
**Problem**: After drag-and-drop, drafts would disappear from calendar because frontend state wasn't updated
**Solution**: 
- Backend now returns complete updated draft object after scheduling
- Frontend properly updates state with the returned draft data
- Updated `get_drafts()` to include both 'draft' and 'future' status posts

### 4. No Visual Distinction for Scheduled Posts
**Problem**: Scheduled drafts looked the same as unscheduled ones
**Solution**: Added yellow background (#fff3cd) for scheduled drafts vs blue for unscheduled

### 5. Scheduled Items Not Clickable
**Problem**: Users couldn't click on scheduled items to view/edit them
**Solution**: Made scheduled drafts clickable with proper `onSelectPost` handler

## Technical Changes Made

### Backend (PHP)
1. **`schedule_draft()` function** - Enhanced to:
   - Handle both `date` and `scheduledDate` parameters
   - Validate and parse dates properly
   - Update WordPress post scheduling with `post_status: 'future'`
   - Return complete updated draft object instead of just `success: true`

2. **`get_drafts()` function** - Updated to:
   - Include both 'draft' and 'future' status posts
   - Ensure scheduled posts appear in drafts list

3. **`format_post_for_api()` function** - Enhanced to:
   - Map WordPress 'future' status to frontend 'draft' status
   - Properly handle scheduled post data

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
1. **`handleScheduleDraft()` function** - Improved to:
   - Handle complete draft object response from API
   - Update state properly with scheduled draft data
   - Provide better error handling and user feedback

2. **ContentCalendar component** - Enhanced to:
   - Display scheduled drafts with yellow background
   - Make scheduled items clickable for editing
   - Show proper visual indicators for different post types
   - Updated instructions panel for clarity

## User Experience Improvements

## Files Modified
