# Critical Scheduling Fix - Version 1.3.4

## 🚨 Issue Identified

**Problem**: When dragging drafts to calendar dates, posts were being **published immediately** instead of being **scheduled for the target date**.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the `schedule_draft()` function in `class-aca-rest-api.php`:

### Original Problem
1. **Date Processing**: When dragging to a calendar date, the system received dates like `2025-01-28T00:00:00.000Z` (midnight)
2. **Time Comparison**: The function compared `$wordpress_date > $current_time` 
3. **False Logic**: If current time was after midnight (which it usually is), the condition was false
4. **Wrong Action**: Instead of scheduling, it would update the post without setting `post_status: 'future'`
5. **Result**: Posts appeared as published immediately instead of scheduled

### Example Scenario
- User drags draft to January 30th at 2:00 PM
- System receives: `2025-01-30T00:00:00.000Z` (midnight)
- Current time: `2025-01-28 14:00:00` (2 PM today)
- Comparison: `2025-01-30 00:00:00 > 2025-01-28 14:00:00` = **TRUE** ✅
- But if dragging to today's date:
- System receives: `2025-01-28T00:00:00.000Z` (midnight today)
- Current time: `2025-01-28 14:00:00` (2 PM today)  
- Comparison: `2025-01-28 00:00:00 > 2025-01-28 14:00:00` = **FALSE** ❌
- Result: Post published immediately instead of scheduled

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Smart Time Detection**
```php
// If time is 00:00:00 (midnight), it means we got just a date from calendar drag-drop
if ($time_part === '00:00:00') {
    // Set to 9:00 AM of that date to ensure it's in the future for scheduling
    $parsed_date->setTime(9, 0, 0);
}
```

### 2. **Date-Based Logic Instead of Time-Based**
```php
// Always schedule for future if it's a calendar date, don't publish immediately
$today = date('Y-m-d');
$target_date = $parsed_date->format('Y-m-d');

// If target date is today or future, schedule it; if past date, just update the date
if ($target_date >= $today) {
    // Schedule for future - set post status to 'future'
    $update_result = wp_update_post(array(
        'ID' => $post_id,
        'post_status' => 'future',
        'post_date' => $wordpress_date,
        'post_date_gmt' => get_gmt_from_date($wordpress_date)
    ));
}
```

### 3. **Comprehensive Debug Logging**
Added detailed logging to track the scheduling process:
- Post ID and parameters received
- Date processing steps  
- Time adjustments made
- Final scheduling decisions

## 📋 Debug Information

When troubleshooting, check WordPress debug logs for entries like:
```
ACA Schedule Draft: Post ID = 123
ACA Schedule Draft: Scheduled Date = 2025-01-30T00:00:00.000Z
ACA Schedule Draft: Set time to 9:00 AM for calendar date
ACA Schedule Draft: WordPress Date = 2025-01-30 09:00:00
ACA Schedule Draft: Today = 2025-01-28, Target Date = 2025-01-30
ACA Schedule Draft: Setting post status to FUTURE
```
