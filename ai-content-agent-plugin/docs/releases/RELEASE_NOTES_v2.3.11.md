### 🔧 Critical Fixes

#### **Plugin Activation Errors Fixed**
- **Fixed PHP Fatal Error**: Removed extra closing brace on line 290 in `ai-content-agent.php` that caused immediate activation failure

#### **Dependency Management**
- **Updated Composer Dependencies**: Properly installed Google API Client v2.18.3 and all required dependencies
- **Fixed Autoloader Issues**: Replaced placeholder autoload.php with proper Composer-generated autoloader
- **Removed Invalid Dependencies**: Removed non-existent `google/generative-ai-php` package from composer.json

#### **Asset Management**
- **Rebuilt Frontend Assets**: Regenerated all JavaScript and CSS assets using npm build pipeline
- **Updated Asset Loading**: Enhanced asset loading with proper fallback mechanisms
- **Version Consistency**: Updated all version references to 2.3.11 across all files

### 🚀 Deployment Ready

This release is now **deployment ready** and should resolve the "Plugin could not be activated because it triggered a fatal error" issues reported by users.

### 📦 Installation

1. **Download**: `releases/ai-content-agent-v2.3.11.zip`
2. **Upload** to WordPress via Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin
3. **Activate** - Should now activate without errors
4. **Configure** your API keys in the plugin settings

### 🔍 What Was Causing the Activation Errors

The activation failures were caused by multiple PHP syntax and structural issues:

1. **PHP Parse Error**: Extra closing brace created invalid syntax
2. **Class Structure Violations**: Methods defined outside class scope
3. **Duplicate Declarations**: Same methods declared multiple times
4. **Missing Dependencies**: Placeholder autoloader instead of real Composer dependencies
5. **Class Loading Issues**: Classes used before being properly loaded

All these issues have been systematically identified and resolved in this release.

### 🛡️ Quality Assurance

- ✅ All PHP files pass syntax validation
- ✅ All required dependencies are properly installed
- ✅ Frontend assets are properly built and optimized
- ✅ Version numbers are consistent across all files
- ✅ Error handling is improved with proper try-catch blocks

### 📞 Support

If you continue to experience activation issues after installing v2.3.11, please:

1. **Check PHP Version**: Ensure PHP 7.4+ is installed
2. **Verify Dependencies**: Ensure Composer dependencies are present in `/vendor/`
3. **Check File Permissions**: Ensure WordPress can read all plugin files
4. **Review Error Logs**: Check WordPress debug logs for specific error messages
