## 🔍 TECHNICAL TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Database Queries for Support**

#### **Check if License Key is Stored (Most Common Issue)**
```sql
SELECT option_value 
FROM wp_options 
WHERE option_name = 'aca_license_key';
```
**Expected**: Should return the license key, not empty

#### **Check Complete License Status**
```sql
SELECT option_name, option_value 
FROM wp_options 
WHERE option_name LIKE 'aca_license_%' 
ORDER BY option_name;
```
**Expected Results**:
- `aca_license_status`: 'active'
- `aca_license_key`: [license key]
- `aca_license_verified`: [hash value]  
- `aca_license_timestamp`: [recent timestamp]

#### **Verify License Validation Chain**
```sql
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wp_options WHERE option_name = 'aca_license_status' AND option_value = 'active') as status_check,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wp_options WHERE option_name = 'aca_license_verified' AND option_value IS NOT NULL) as verified_check,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wp_options WHERE option_name = 'aca_license_timestamp' AND CAST(option_value AS UNSIGNED) > (UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - 86400)) as timestamp_check,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wp_options WHERE option_name = 'aca_license_key' AND option_value IS NOT NULL AND option_value != '') as key_check;
```
**Expected**: All values should be 1 for working Pro license

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Issue**: License shows active but Pro features return 403
**Cause**: License key not stored in database (pre-v2.4.2 bug)
**Solution**: 
1. Re-verify license key in settings
2. Check if `aca_license_key` option exists in database
3. If missing, have user re-enter license key

#### **Issue**: Automation settings still showing "Loading..."
**Cause**: Browser cache or JavaScript error
**Solution**:
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Clear WordPress cache if using caching plugin

#### **Issue**: Content Freshness Manager not loading
**Cause**: API endpoint issues or license validation
**Solution**:
1. Verify `/aca/v1/gsc/status` endpoint is working
2. Check license validation status
3. Test other Pro endpoints
