== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is the plugin free? =
Yes, the core features of ACA (manual idea and draft generation, style analysis, GSC integration, etc.) are completely free. For advanced features like the Content Cluster Planner, DALL-E 3 image generation, plagiarism checks, and full automation, you will need to upgrade to ACA Pro.

= How do I get ACA Pro? =
ACA Pro is available through Gumroad. You can purchase a license at our Gumroad store, and you'll receive a license key via email. Enter this key in the License tab of the plugin settings to unlock all Pro features.

= What happens if my license expires? =
ACA Pro licenses are perpetual and don't expire. However, if you need a refund or your purchase is refunded, the Pro features will be deactivated. You can always purchase a new license to reactivate Pro features.

= Can I use the same license on multiple sites? =
Each license is valid for one WordPress installation. If you need to use ACA Pro on multiple sites, you'll need to purchase separate licenses for each site.

= Is the generated content original and will it pass AI detectors? =
Yes, ACA generates original content based on your style guide and existing content. The AI creates unique content that matches your writing style, making it difficult for AI detectors to identify as machine-generated.

= How does the style guide work? =
ACA analyzes your existing published posts to understand your writing style, tone, and preferences. It then uses this information to generate new content that matches your brand voice perfectly.

= Can I customize the AI prompts? =
Yes, you can customize the prompts used for idea generation, draft creation, and style guide generation in the Prompts settings tab.

= What if I don't have a Google Gemini API key? =
You can get a free Google Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey). The free tier includes generous usage limits for most users.

= How often should I regenerate the style guide? =
We recommend regenerating your style guide weekly or whenever you publish significant new content. This ensures the AI stays current with your evolving writing style.

= Can I use ACA with other content plugins? =
Yes, ACA is designed to work alongside other WordPress plugins. It creates standard WordPress posts that can be edited, scheduled, and published like any other content.

= Is my content safe and private? =
Yes, ACA respects your privacy. Your content is only sent to Google Gemini for processing and is not stored or used for any other purpose. All API communications are encrypted.

= What if I'm not satisfied with the generated content? =
All generated content is saved as drafts, so you can review and edit before publishing. You can also provide feedback on ideas to improve future generations.
